adding to rc522 module 

-rc522_query_a_tags: To handle the transmission and reception of REQA / ATQA
doesnt matter if there is a collision, we just need to know if cards available.
?alternate between req and wakeup commands?

-rc522_anticollision_loop: To transmit out the select/anticollision command until all tags found
set rc522 Coll register to keep all data so we get valid bits too
