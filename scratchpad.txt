adding to rc522 module 

-rc522_InListPassiveTarget:

-rc522_InDeselect:

-rc522_query_a_tags: To handle the transmission and reception of REQA / ATQA
doesnt matter if there is a collision, we just need to know if cards available.
?alternate between req and wakeup commands?

-rc522_select_anticollision_loop: To transmit out the select/anticollision command until all tags found
set rc522 Coll register to keep all data so we get valid bits too

-rc522_RATS: request RATS when called


usefull snippets:
nfc_initiator_select_passive_target(pnd, nmMifare, nt.nti.nai.abtUid, nt.nti.nai.szUidLen, NULL) <= 0) {
select should scan WUPA(wakeup all and check). If no data given, otherwise select a card based on uid.

bah! Now needing to add definitions for various commands to properly emulate easy framing.
starting with mifare commands, and the disabling of crc for those specific commands.
