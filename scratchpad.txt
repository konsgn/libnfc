adding to rc522 module 

-rc522_InListPassiveTarget:

-rc522_InDeselect:

-rc522_query_a_tags: To handle the transmission and reception of REQA / ATQA
doesnt matter if there is a collision, we just need to know if cards available.
?alternate between req and wakeup commands?

-rc522_select_anticollision_loop: To transmit out the select/anticollision command until all tags found
set rc522 Coll register to keep all data so we get valid bits too

-rc522_RATS: request RATS when called


usefull snippets:
nfc_initiator_select_passive_target(pnd, nmMifare, nt.nti.nai.abtUid, nt.nti.nai.szUidLen, NULL) <= 0) {
select should scan WUPA(wakeup all and check). If no data given, otherwise select a card based on uid.

bah! Now needing to add definitions for various commands to properly emulate easy framing.
starting with mifare commands, and the disabling of crc for those specific commands.
Double Bah! it seems mifare communication of authentication commands happens in more than one exchange,
easy_framing for the pn53x seems to hide all that from the examples. this is going to be harder than expected.
Less Bah! it seems rc522 can also do authentication/ crypto enable for mifare.. Woo!

... Perhaps it is time to completely redesign the rc522.c code.

... Simplifying code into less subfunctions... adding baud rate change support

LIBNFC_LOG_LEVEL=3 LIBNFC_DEFAULT_DEVICE="rc522_uart:/dev/ttyUSB0" libfreefare/examples/mifare-desfire-info

.. implement easy_framing properly... need to create frame commands from iso14443-4
